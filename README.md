# Suspension Kinematic Solver

This tool models front wishbone suspension geometry with dynamic updates based on damper length changes across roll, pitch, and heave. Built for simulation clarity and modular refinement.

## Features
- Dynamic geometry updates based on damper input
- Modular structure for easy extension
- Physically traceable logic for roll, pitch, and heave

## Instructions for Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rtgibberd/suspension-kinematic-solver.git

2. You will first be shown an image of the suspension setup based on the Team Bath Racing Electric vehicle's hardpoints. This is to allow you to get acquainted with the model
3. Next you will be given the original damper length used, and prompted the length you want to simulate. This has not been restricted for realism as it allows you to simulate any scenario you wish. You will then be able to see the difference between the camber angle from the original position to the damper length you requested. 
4. Lastly, an animation will play demonstrating the model going through a realistic range of motion.
5. A link to the animation can be seen at https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphael-gibberd-354b9430a/
