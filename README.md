# Suspension Kinematic Solver

This tool models front wishbone suspension geometry with dynamic updates based on damper length changes across roll, pitch, and heave. Built for simulation clarity and modular refinement.

## Features
- Dynamic geometry updates based on damper input
- Modular structure for easy extension
- Physically traceable logic for roll, pitch, and heave

## Instructions for Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rtgibberd/suspension-kinematic-solver.git
